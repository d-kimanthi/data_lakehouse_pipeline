# E-Commerce Streaming Analytics Platform

A comprehensive data engineering portfolio project showcasing modern batch and streaming analytics architecture with Kafka, Spark, Dagster, Iceberg, dimension modelling using dbt and cloud technologies for an ecormece business with ratail store in different locations. We will generate fake data to simulate streaming

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project implements a complete real-time analytics platform for e-commerce data, demonstrating:

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Real-time event streaming with Apache Kafka
- **Stream Processing**: Apache Spark Structured Streaming for real-time data processing
- **Data Lakehouse**: Apache Iceberg for ACID transactions and time travel
- **Orchestration**: Dagster for workflow management and data lineage
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS deployment with Terraform
- **Analytics**: Business intelligence dashboards

## üìä What This Project Demonstrates

### 1. **Real-Time Data Streaming**

- **Kafka Integration**: Multi-topic event streaming with proper partitioning
- **Schema Management**: Confluent Schema Registry for event schema evolution
- **Event Generation**: Realistic e-commerce event simulation with user behaviors

### 2. **Advanced Stream Processing**

- **Spark Structured Streaming**: Complex event processing with watermarking
- **Real-time Aggregations**: Windowed analytics and session reconstruction
- **Data Quality**: Stream validation, anomaly detection, and error handling

### 3. **Modern Data Architecture**

- **Iceberg Tables**: ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel
- **Lakehouse Pattern**: Bronze/Silver/Gold data layers
- **Cloud Storage**: S3 integration

### 4. **Production-Grade Orchestration**

- **Dagster Assets**: Software-defined assets with automatic lineage
- **Scheduling**: Complex dependency management and retry logic
- **Data Quality**: Built-in validation and alerting

### 5. **Business Intelligence**

- **Customer Analytics**: CLV, RFM analysis, and segmentation
- **Operational Dashboards**: Real-time monitoring and KPIs
